# zk - terminal text editor

## Getting started

You need [chez scheme](https://github.com/cisco/chezscheme). It's
available on Ubuntu 18.04 as `chezscheme` but the development happens
against `git` version. You will also need
[`akku`](http://akkuscm.org/).

Once you have scheme, I assume you have git, you can proceed with the
following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:amirouche/zk.git --recursive
$ cd zk
$ make dev
```
